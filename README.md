## Introduction

LabForAll is an innovative and interactive virtual science lab designed for students to enhance their understanding of physics, chemistry, and biology through real-life experiments and simulations. The project was inspired by the belief that hands-on learning is the most effective way for students to grasp complex concepts and retain knowledge.


## Inspiration
- Our goal is to make the understanding of lab experiments simple and interactive for the students.


## What it does

- In LabForALL, you get the opportunity to access every details about your lab experiments ranging from procedures to precautions, apparatus setup to complete guide video on how to perform the experiments.
- There is a Query Submition section where you can post your doubts/issues and we will be answering to your question as soon as possible!!
- We have provided a Simulation Section where the students can get interactive-access to their learning module.
- Also, they can track their Progress and Performance.


## How we built it

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Figma
- Firebase
- ThreeJs


## Challenges we ran into

- The main challenges we faced was creating accurate and realistic 3D simulations of the experiments. It took several iterations and testing to ensure that the simulations were both accurate and engaging.
- Another challenge was making sure the virtual lab was accessible and user-friendly for everyone especially those with different backgrounds and disabilities.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- To create something useful for the students which will boost their academic performance.
- Successful creation and implementation of the Simulation.
- Successful implementation of FireBase to our site.


## What we learnt

- Team Work and Time Management
- And, through the development of LabForAll, we learned the importance of hands-on learning and the potential of virtual labs to revolutionize science education. We also learned the importance of testing and iterating on a project to ensure that it is accessible and engaging for students. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in web development, particularly in the use of React.js and Three.js.


## What is the future of LabForAll
- We will be adding more and more experiments and simulations to the existing lot in the coming time.
- We look forward to host this site on our own domain and open it for the students, if we win this hackathon or something.


## Installation

First clone this repository. You can also fork this repository and then clone the forked one.

```
git clone https://github.com/samyabrata-maji/experiments-website
```

Make sure you have Node Package Manager (npm) installed. Will work with most versions, but the latest (LTS) is recommended.

Now you need to install all the dependencies.
```
cd experiments-website
yarn install
```

You are done with the installation.

To run the website, use the following command
```
yarn dev
```

- The website will be live at https://localhost:5173/

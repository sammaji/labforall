## Inspiration
- Our goal is to make the understanding of lab experiments simple and interactive for the students.


## What it does

- In LabForALL, you get the opportunity to access every details about your lab experiments ranging from procedures to observation tables, apparatus setup to complete guide video on how to perform the experiments.
- There is a Query Submition section where you can post your doubts/issues and we will be answering to your question as soon as possible!!
- We have provided a Simulation Section where the students can get interactive-access to their learning module.
- The students can take digital notes while doing the experiments on a side-bar dedicated for that purpose.
- Also, they can track their Progress and Performance.


## How we built it

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Figma
- Firebase
- ThreeJs


## Challenges we ran into

- We didn't have a lot of experience with FireBase and it was fairly new to us, but we managed to learn it to accomplish our job.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- To create something useful for the students which will boost their academic performance.
- Successful creation and implementation of the Simulation.
- Successful implementation of FireBase to our site.


## What we learnt

- Time Management
- Team Work
- FireBase


## What is the future of LabForAll
- We will be adding more and more experiments and simulations to the existing lot in the coming time.
- We look forward to host this site and open it for the students, if we win this hackathon or something.
